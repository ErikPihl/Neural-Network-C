# Neural-Network-C
Implementation of a dynamic neural network consisting of one input layer, one output layer and one or multiple hidden layers. 
In this example, three hidden layers are used, which is sufficient for pattern detection in this particular case. 

Training data is retrieved from a file named data.txt. The network is trained to detect the pattern of a 3-input XOR gate. 
After training, the model is tested with input data from the training sets and the predicted output is printed in the terminal.

Code is written in C. Comments are written in Swedish.
